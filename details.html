<h2>Bees are the most important insect on the planet</h2>

<p>Bees have been around for thousands of years. Being one of the largest groups of pollinators on the planet,
    bees are responsible for not just the reproduction of flowering plants, but also being depended on for food like jelly, honey, and many fruits and vegetables
   that come from flowering plants. 
</p>

<p>But most of these bees are currently endangered. Use of pesticides, habitat loss, and climate change have drastically decreased the bee population.
    If bees end up going extinct, the entire worldly ecosystem will collapse.

<p>
We can help the bee population by simply planting flowering plants at home, even if you don't have much space. It's amazing how little space you need to make a home for bees.
