</p>

<h3>2. Dog</h3>

<p>Man's best friend. Almost everyone has one. With many different breeds of dog, <br>
you can't go wrong with having a dog or two.
</p>

<h3>3. Rabbit</h3>

Fun fact: Carrots are actually harmful to rabbits. They actually prefer wheat.
</p>

<h3>4. Owl</h3>

Owls can also turn their heads 180 degrees.
</p>

<h3>5. Bees</h3>

<p>The most important insect on the planet, these little guys can boast on keeping entire ecosystems alive. <br>
